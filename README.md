# Simple Linear Regression Project: Predicting Scores based on Hours of Study

## Overview
This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict student scores based on the number of hours they study. By analyzing the relationship between study hours and scores, we aim to provide insights into academic performance prediction.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the code:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Results
The linear regression model accurately predicts student scores based on study hours, as indicated by low error metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE) and a high R-squared score.
